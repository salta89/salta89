I bridge the gap between qualitative understanding and quantitative evidence, leveraging my unique skillset to translate data
into actionable insights that drive impactful results across various industries. 
With a Bachelor's degree in Sociology and a Master's degree in Media and Communication Systems, 
I possess a strong foundation in social research, critical analysis, and understanding the media landscape.
I seamlessly blend this expertise with proficiency in SQL, Python, and Tableau, enabling me to:

- Uncover hidden patterns and trends in complex datasets: I dive deep into data to identify key insights, 
measure performance, and evaluate the impact of initiatives.

- Craft compelling data-driven narratives: I transform complex findings into clear, concise, 
and visually engaging stories that resonate with diverse audiences.

- Guide informed decision-making: I deliver actionable recommendations grounded in data, 
empowering stakeholders to make strategic choices with confidence.
